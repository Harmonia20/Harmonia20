- 👋 Hi, I’m @Harmonia20, a beginner in web development.
- 👀 I’m interested in building web applications, learning more about front-end and back-end development, and exploring how to create dynamic and responsive websites.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and CSS, and I’m eager to dive into JavaScript and other web technologies soon.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly projects that involve HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’m excited to work on simple web projects to apply what I’m learning.
